## dt money is a personal finance control application created in the second module on Ignite's ReactJS track🚀.
## in this module we saw:
* How to create a pre-configured structure with Create React App.
* Divide the application into components.
* Create stylized components with styled-components.
* Create a Fake API with MirageJS.
* Consume an API.
* Create a Modal.
* Share information between components with the Context API.
* Create a hook.
## And as a challenge, I decided to implement the dark mode in the application.
